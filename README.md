This was supposed to be an LRU Cache script for holding information until the information is too old and is removed subsequently.

A list with a maximum index of 3 is created to hold up to 3 values. If data is recalled from this list, then it moves that specific
recalled data back up to the first index of the list (recently used). However, if a fourth item is added, then the lowest index (3rd item)
is removed and everything is shifted back by one making room for the new data in the first index.

I hope that makes sense I am not changing it.
